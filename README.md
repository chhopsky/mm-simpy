A simple matchmaking simulator comparing stochastic matchmaking results (no SBMM) with SBMM results while attempting to play with a friend who is bad

to the surprise of absolutely no-one, the friend has a way better time with SBMM because:
1. the matches are more likely to be balanced
2. the average skill of the participants is lower
   
we are not simulating changing elo on account of that i didn't feel like it
